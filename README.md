## How to run the app

- clone the app to local directory with `git clone https://github.com/kent10ou/Reddit_Native.git`
- install dependencies with `npm install`
- `npm start` will run the app in dev mode 
  - download the [Expo app](https://expo.io) to view it on your iPhone
- I recommend running `npm run ios` which will open the app in the iOS simulator if you have it installed on your Mac

## Features

- [X] Use Redux
- [X] Create a main screen that fetches from Redditâ€™s API (https://www.reddit.com/.json) and displays the basic content (author, title, thumbnail, up votes, etc) in a list
- [X] Users should be able to pull to refresh the list
- [X] Clicking on a specific item should transition to a different screen within the app. This screen's content can simply display the same basic content. Users should be able to go back to the main screen (React Navigation is a good option for this)
- [X] Create a public Github repo for this project with instructions on how to get the app running and send me the link after you're done

-----

- [ ] Store the fetched content locally so that if you relaunch the app, it will display that content first before fetching for new content. I recommend using Redux Persist or AsyncStorage
- [ ] Works for both iOS and Android
- [X] Share some words about your thought process, design/architectural decisions, challenges you faced, etc

## Thoughts, Designs, Challenges

I hadn't worked on a React Native project since the summer of 2015 when it was still fairly new! It seems like a lot has changed and developing on an app is much easier to get started with the `create-react-native-app` command. I initially started by creating the app structure with redux with actions, reducers, store, and the file for entry to the application. Once I was able to fetch the posts, I had some issues displaying the data. There were several ways to show the data. First thing I did was show the title of the posts. Next was to determine to use which type of components: scrollview, listview, flatlist. I found that FlatList also supports pull to refresh functionality with the `onRefresh` and `refreshing` properties. Once the items were displayed, I wrapped them in a <TouchableHighlight /> to make them clickable. This will provide a `onPress` property which will later trigger the navigation to next scene. I also encountered a few issues with `react-navigation`.
